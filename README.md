# Azure Honeypot & SIEM Project
 - This project documents the deployment and analysis of a **Cowrie SSH honeypot** on an **Azure VM**.
- The honeypot captures unauthorised/authorised login attempts and terminal activity which is then forwarded to **Microsoft Sentinel** via **Azure Monitor/Log Analytics**, allowing for real-time **threat detection** and **monitoring**.
- This demonstrates both **offensive/defensive** security skills, showcasing practical experience in **threat analysis**, **detection** and **penetration testing**.
